Hi All,

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. This is a quote often attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, and it's a statement that rings true in many different areas including Machine Learning. There is a principle called the [Feynman Razor](https://twitter.com/sahilbloom/status/1548654048739528706) which states if someone uses a lot of complexity and jargon (you can recall at least one of your meetings where you had to pitch in for a machine learning project) to explain something, they probably don't understand it. The complexity and jargon are used to mark a lack of deep understanding.

As we were building and expanding our India and US teams, I interviewed around 50 candidates for Data Scientist and Sr. Data Scientist positions, I noticed a common challenge: many of the candidates struggled to explain machine learning concepts in simple terms. They were familiar with the definitions, formulas etc, but could not explain without the jargon. This was surprising to me, as being able to clearly articulate complex ideas is an important skill for anyone working in data science. It shows the ability to understand and communicate the underlying principles of machine learning, and to make them accessible to a wider audience.

In my experience, the best data scientists are able to take complex ideas and break them down into simple, easy-to-understand concepts. They can explain the basics of machine learning to someone with no technical background, create the stories from their surroundings, and can also dive deeper into the details for those who are more familiar with the subject.

👉 If you can’t explain it to a 5-year-old, you don’t really understand it! 🧒
