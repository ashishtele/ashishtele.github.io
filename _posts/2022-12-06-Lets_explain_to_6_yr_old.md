Hi All,

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. This is a quote often attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, and it's a statement that rings true in many different areas including Machine Learning. There is a principle called the Feynman Razor which states if someone uses a lot of complexity and jargon (you can recall alteast one of your meetings where you had to pich in for machine learning project) to explain something, they probably don't understand it. The complexity and jargon are used to mark a lack of deep understnaing.
