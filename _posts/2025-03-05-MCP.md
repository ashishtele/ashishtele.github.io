Hi All,

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is a standard proposed by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) for connecting AI assistants to the systems where data lives, including content repositories, business tools, and development environments. MCP is a universal connector that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to access real-time data and execute actions dynamically through standardized integrations.
