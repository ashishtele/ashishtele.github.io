Hi All,

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is a standard proposed by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) for connecting AI assistants to the systems where data lives, including content repositories, business tools, and development environments. MCP is a universal connector that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to access real-time data and execute actions dynamically through standardized integrations.

The popularity and adoptability are just growing. Sam has just announced support for MCP, and it is great news for developers as it opens up more doors. Google has just released MCP support.

## How Does MCP Work (The Basics)?

MCP uses a client-server architecture:

**MCP Host/Client:** An AI application (like an IDE, a chatbot like Claude Desktop, or a custom workflow tool) needing external data or capabilities.

**MCP Server:** A lightweight program that exposes specific data sources (e.g., a database, file system, API like GitHub or Slack) or tools through the standardized MCP interface.

**The Protocol:** Defines the standardized communication rules, including discovering capabilities, requesting data, executing actions (tool use), managing security, and handling different transport mechanisms (like WebSockets or SSE).

When the AI client needs information or needs to act (e.g., "Summarize the latest changes in the 'HCP' folder on Google Storage Bucket"), it communicates with the relevant MCP server using the protocol. The server then interacts with the actual data source or tool and sends the necessary information back to the AI client.

## Why Does MCP Matter? Key Benefits:

MCP offers significant advantages for developers, users, and the AI ecosystem as a whole:

**Standardization & Simplified Integration:** Reduces the complexity of connecting AI to external systems. Build one MCP server for your tool, and multiple AI clients can use it. We can have a department/company-specific server with restricted access.

**Flexibility & Interoperability:** Easily switch between different LLM providers or AI clients without rebuilding integrations. Fosters a richer ecosystem of compatible tools and applications.

**Enhanced AI Capabilities:** Enables AI models to access real-time, relevant data and perform actions, leading to more accurate, practical, and context-aware responses and workflows.

**Improved Security:** Provides best practices and mechanisms for securely exposing data and managing access, often keeping data within your infrastructure.

**Better Developer Experience:** Simplifies the process of building sophisticated AI agents and workflows that interact with the real world.

**Scalability:** Supports various communication methods and makes it easier to add new tools and data sources as needed.


Thank you!
