MLOps is a newly minted word. As per Wikipedia, "MLOps or ML Ops is a set of practices that aims to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently. The word is a compound of "machine learning" and the continuous development practice of DevOps in the software field". Companies are flocking to go behind it. Myriad PaaS startups are offering end-to-end services. MLOps market is projected to reach [$126 billion](https://neu.ro/2021-mlops-platforms-vendor-analysis-report/) by 2025.

I want to highlight a few resources that are useful for the MLOps journey. I reached out to many people, searched on Github and Reddit, joined multiple Discord channels, followed many researchers on Twitter to gather some of these. I hope you will find it useful as well. If you have anything to append to this ever-growing list, please feel free to leave a comment.

## [CS 329S: Machine Learning Systems Design](https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/syllabus.html)

This course is unquestionably the most unique, first-of-its-kind machine learning system design course. The course is taught by [Chip](https://twitter.com/chipro) at Stanford. It touches all aspects of ML system design with practical examples and significance. I found lecture notes comprehensive to refresh ML system design basics. We should be grateful to them for making it available for FREE.

## [Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2015/file/86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Paper.pdf)

People who are in the ML system design field or are interested in MLOps must have come across this paper or its reference. Many blogs give credit to this paper (2015) by Google for highlighting the importance of infrastructure in real-world ML systems. It explains that the maintenance costs in real-world ML systems are massive and can not be decoupled from the ML ecosystem.
