I have been experimenting with RAG for a few use cases and I agree with the below statement by LlamaIndex:

```
Prototyping a RAG application is easy, but making it performant, robust, and scalable to a large knowledge corpus is hard.
```
What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for LLMs?

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) aims to improve prediction quality by using an external datastore at inference time to create an enriched prompt that combines context and relevant knowledge. Vector databases provide the external data for RAG LLMs. LLM uses the user input prompt to retrieve external “context” information from a data store that is then included with the user-entered prompt to build a richer prompt containing context information that otherwise would not have been available to the LLM.
