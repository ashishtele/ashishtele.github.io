Hi All,

Lately, I started coding extensively on Databricks (Microsoft Azure) using PySpark and SparkR. The platform is versatile as we can use the language of our preference interchangeably. I prefer R (a personal favorite) over Python. I find data cleaning, data transformation (dplyr), and visualization very intuitive in R. PySpark syntax are also easy to grasp. I want to highlight some of my findings and a few of the great resources I came across.
