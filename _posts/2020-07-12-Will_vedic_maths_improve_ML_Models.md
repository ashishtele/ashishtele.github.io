Hi All,

[Vedic Mathematics](http://mathlearners.com/) is a collection of Techniques/Sutras to solve mathematical arithmetics in an easy and faster way. There is a famous book called Vedic Mathematics by Bharati Krishna Tirtha. It has many mathematical techniques. Though the claimed source of Vedas is rejected, the tricks of fast calculations are still intriguing.

I still remember the hot summer holidays between the school terms when I used to spend time in cricket camps, painting, or reading. I was and yet am fascinated by the Vedic mathematics tricks. I remember spending time in the Cyber Cafes (nostalgia!!) watching the math tricks on the internet and writing them down.
