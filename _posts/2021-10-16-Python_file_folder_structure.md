Hello,

I recently made a transition from the Azure + Databricks platform to GCP (Google Cloud). So far I am enjoying the capabilities that GCP offer to Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers. Vertex AI and the recent introduction of the [Vertex AI workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench) show the commitment from Google towards ML/AI practitioners. 

Most of you must have come across ['cookiecutter'](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter), a project template for data science projects. It is a fantastic template format for ML projects, but it feels overwhelming for small DS projects. I tried to leverage the format for some of my initial DS projects, but could not use all the capabilities under it. I searched a lot to find the best fit for my projects, but there is no perfect way to do it. Finally, after researching and referring to multiple open source projects, I  wireframed my own! 

[Data Science for Social Good](https://github.com/dssg) has many projects and pipelines they follow. The typical workflow I also use as per the diagram. Excuse my handwriting here. I am learning to use [XP-PEN](https://www.xp-pen.com/).
