Hello,

Hello,

I recently made a transition from the Azure + Databricks platform to GCP (Google Cloud). So far I am enjoying the capabilities that GCP offer to Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers. Vertex AI and the recent introduction of the [Vertex AI workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench) show the commitment from Google towards ML/AI practitioners.
