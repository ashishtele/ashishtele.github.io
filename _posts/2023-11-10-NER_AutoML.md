Hi All,

Unlocking the potential of AutoML on Vertex AI, a key component of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) suite, opens doors to a myriad of machine learning applications. From regression to classification and entity extraction, AutoML simplifies complex tasks. This article focuses on custom entity extraction — a crucial aspect of natural language processing.

This article is part of an ongoing series on custom entity extraction. If you missed the previous articles, you can catch up by following [this link](https://ashishtele.github.io/2023/11/NER.html) for a comprehensive read.

Vertex AI is a comprehensive end-to-end machine learning solution within GCP, addressing every facet of machine learning. If you’re unfamiliar with this powerful service, you can delve into the details in my previous article.

As part of this exercise, we will be consuming:

* VertexAI Datasets
* Automl training

> Assumption: You have already created a project and enabled VertexAI APIs in the project. If not, please enable it once prompted during the process or when you encounter an error related to that.

On VertexAI, we can use the workbench to launch jupterlab notebook and write our commands.
