Hi All,

If you are following the advancement in the field of AI recently, it is impossible not to notice the enormous growth in data/corpus size. In particular, recent breakthroughs in the field of unstructured data, such as large language models like GPT-3, protein folding prediction systems like AlphaFold, and differentiable programming frameworks like DELLE, have demonstrated the need for efficient storage and fast retrieval of massive amounts of high-dimensional data. This is where [vector databases](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/#:~:text=Vector%20databases%20are%20purpose%2Dbuilt,most%20similar%20to%20one%20another.) come into the picture.

In recent years, machine learning has seen significant advancements in the form of deep learning algorithms. These algorithms often involve working with high-dimensional data in the form of vectors. As a result, vector databases have become an important tool for machine learning practitioners and vector embedding is a key to it.

Vector embedding allows us to convert text, images etc. into numbers that can be easily processed by computers. These numerical representations are designed in such a way that similar objects are represented by similar vectors, and the distance between the vectors reflects the degree of similarity between the objects. Vector embeddings are leveraged for tasks such as clustering, classification, recommendation etc.
