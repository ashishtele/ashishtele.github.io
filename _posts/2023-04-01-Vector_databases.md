Hi All,

If you are following the advancement in the field of AI recently, it is impossible not to notice the enormous growth in data/corpus size. In particular, recent breakthroughs in the field of unstructured data, such as large language models like GPT-3, protein folding prediction systems like AlphaFold, and differentiable programming frameworks like DELLE, have demonstrated the need for efficient storage and fast retrieval of massive amounts of high-dimensional data. This is where [vector databases](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/#:~:text=Vector%20databases%20are%20purpose%2Dbuilt,most%20similar%20to%20one%20another.) come into the picture.

In recent years, machine learning has seen significant advancements in the form of deep learning algorithms. These algorithms often involve working with high-dimensional data in the form of vectors. As a result, vector databases have become an important tool for machine learning practitioners and vector embedding is a key to it.
