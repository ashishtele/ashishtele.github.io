Hi All,

[Weights & Biases](https://docs.wandb.ai/) is a ML platform. As per the site, W&B's tools can be used to:
Track experiments
Version and iterate on datasets
Evaluate model perfomance
Reproduce models
Visualize results

As a part of the End to End MLOps project, I worked on MLFlow to track the model artifacts, hyperparameters, etc. I have also worked on MLFlow + Databricks combo at the enterprise level and found it very helpful. [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) is one of the experiment tracking tools out there in the market. Neptune and Wandb.ai are the other two promising entries. I thought of giving a try to W&B to see its functionality.
