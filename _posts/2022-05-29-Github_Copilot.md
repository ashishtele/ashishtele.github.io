Hey there,

If you are a programming nerd, then you must have heard about the Github Copilot initiate. The project claims it as 'Your AI pair programmer'. 
I had to wait a long to  access to the technical preview. I use it regularly on my personal laptop as an extension for VS Code and so far, I have been enjoying it!

Those who don't know, it is an AI pair programmer that helps to code faster. It draws context from comments and code to suggest lines of code . It is powered by OpenAI Codex and was trained on publicly available souce code and natural language. It does not write perfect code rather tries to understand intent and generate the best code it can.
