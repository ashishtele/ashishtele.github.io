Hey All,

[Gradio](https://gradio.app/) is an open-source python library that allows us to create an easy-to-use, customizable user interface for our ML models in just a few lines of code. We can integrate the GUI into our Python script, or we can share the link with anyone.

We have a couple of alternatives available such as Streamlit, Flask, etc to interface model outputs. I think having a UI for ML output provides a layer of translation from technical to layman language. It becomes very easy to demonstrate the power of the ML model to stakeholders by showing the working MVP (MLP !) by changing the values on the UI. I found Streamlit and Gradio very easy to code, quick to spin up, and flashy to impress!
