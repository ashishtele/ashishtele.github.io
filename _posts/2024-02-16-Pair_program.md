Hi All,

I recently completed a course titled "Pair Programming with an LLM" offered by [Laurence Moroney](https://laurencemoroney.com/), available on deeplearning.ai. The course proved immensely beneficial, providing valuable insights into collaborative programming with Language Models (LLMs).

Within our organization, which heavily utilizes Google technologies, we rely on PaLM and Gemini frameworks for addressing various generative AI use cases. Laurence shared practical insights that I can implement and upskill others at the organization. 

Thanks,
Ashish
