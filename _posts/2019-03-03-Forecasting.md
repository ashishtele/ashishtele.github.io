Hi All,
The first blog post highlights the content for the upcoming posts.

1. Introduction
2. Problem Statement
3. Business Logic
4. Data Review and Understanding
5. Feature Engineering and Modeling
6. Future Work

**1. Introduction**

I got an opportunity to work on a demand forecasting project 
which involved secondary research and talking to subject matter experts.
I used SAS Enterprise Guide, SAS Forecasting Studio, and R for end to end solution 
development. 

I used SAS EG to for data manipulation and SAS FS to create (bottom-up) forecasts.
The similar process was followed in R (R Studio IDE) where I leveraged different 
packages to implement the algorithms.

**2. Problem Statement**

Forecast the demand for different products (businesses) considering the historical numbers.
It was a univariate forecasting problem with a forecasting horizon of 12 months.


Keep returning the posts!!
