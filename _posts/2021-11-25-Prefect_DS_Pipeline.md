Hi All,

[Prefect](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect) is a new workflow management system, designed for modern infrastructure and powered by the open-source Prefect Core workflow engine. The team claims that they rebuilt data engineering for the data science era. I was looking for easy to learn, quick-to-set-up, data scientist-friendly tool. I explored Airflow, but found it difficult to learn quickly. No doubt Airflow is a great workflow management platform, but the setup is time-consuming. I also tried [Metaflow](https://metaflow.org/), an open-sourced framework for real-life data science, but could not run successfully on windows OS. Finally, Prefect came to the rescue and fitted perfectly in my MLOps toolkit.
