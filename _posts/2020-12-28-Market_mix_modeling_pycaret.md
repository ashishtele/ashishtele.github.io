Hi All,

The holiday break is a great time to learn something new and impactful. As always, I chose technical stuff over the rest ðŸ˜¬. I had two things to explore and use effectively. The first one is the package ['PyCaret'](https://pycaret.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). As per the documentation, it is an open-source, low-code machine learning python library that automated the machine learning workflows. There are many salient features you can explore.

I think the most profound way to explore and learn new things is to apply the new learnings to some business problem. I decided to choose 'Marketing mix modeling' for that. Marketing mix modeling (MMM) is a statistical analysis such as multivariate regressions on sales and marketing time series data to estimate the impact of various marketing tactics (marketing mix) on sales and then forecast the impact of future sets of tactics. It is often used to optimize advertising mix and promotional tactics with respect to sales revenue or profit. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix_modeling)
