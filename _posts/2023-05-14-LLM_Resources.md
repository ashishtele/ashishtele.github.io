Hi All,

The internet is awash with information about large language models (LLMs). Every day, a plethora of papers are published on LLMs, advancing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks. I personally found it overwhelming to keep up with the research and the rapid pace of development. I am listing a few resources that I found helpful and will keep on adding to this list.

* [The Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)

The blog "The Illustrated Transformer" by [Jay Alammar](https://twitter.com/JayAlammar)  provides a concise and visually appealing explanation of the Transformer model, a basic building block for the current revolution in NLP. It covers the key components and operations of the Transformer, including self-attention and positional encoding, in the best possible way. The blog's illustrations help clarify the model's inner workings, making it accessible and informative for readers interested in understanding the Transformer architecture. If you are a visual learner like me, this should be the starting point for you!

* [Introduction to Large Language Models](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/539)

* [LLM University by Cohere](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/llmu)

The comprehensive NLP curriculum covers the basics to advanced topics in large language models (LLMs). The curriculum is designed for learners from all backgrounds, with hands-on exercises to help you build and deploy your own models. They cover everything from semantic search, generation, classification, embeddings, and more. Their curriculum is one-size-fits-all, so you can pick your own path based on your previous knowledge and goals.
