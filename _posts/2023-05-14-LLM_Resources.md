Hi All,

The internet is awash with information about large language models (LLMs). Every day, a plethora of papers are published on LLMs, advancing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks. I personally found it overwhelming to keep up with the research and the rapid pace of development. I am listing a few resources that I found helpful and will keep on adding to this list.

Its impact is noteworthy, showcasing improvements of up to 32% when compared to the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach.

Moreover, SELF-DISCOVER demonstrates superiority over inference-intensive methodologies like CoT-Self-Consistency by surpassing their performance by over 20%, all while demanding substantially less inference compute, typically in the range of 10-40 times fewer computations.

Additionally, the research illustrates that the reasoning structures self-discovered by this framework exhibit universality across various model families. They seamlessly translate from models like PaLM 2-L to GPT-4 and from GPT-4 to Llama2, displaying similarities with patterns observed in human reasoning processes.
