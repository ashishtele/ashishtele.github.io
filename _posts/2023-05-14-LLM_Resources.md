Hi All,

The internet is awash with information about large language models (LLMs). Every day, a plethora of papers are published on LLMs, advancing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks. I personally found it overwhelming to keep up with the research and the rapid pace of development. I am listing a few resources that I found helpful and will keep on adding to this list.

* [The Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)

The blog "The Illustrated Transformer" by [Jay Alammar](https://twitter.com/JayAlammar)  provides a concise and visually appealing explanation of the Transformer model, a basic building block for the current revolution in NLP. It covers the key components and operations of the Transformer, including self-attention and positional encoding, in the best possible way. The blog's illustrations help clarify the model's inner workings, making it accessible and informative for readers interested in understanding the Transformer architecture. If you are a visual learner like me, this should be the starting point for you!

* [Story of Large Language Models](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/the-full-story-of-large-language-models-and-rlhf/)

AssemblyAI's blog, "The Full Story of Large Language Models and RLHF," explores the innovations and advancements in large language models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). The blog delves into the history and development of LLMs, such as GPT-3, and outlines their capabilities and limitations. It highlights the role of RLHF in fine-tuning LLMs and discusses its potential for improving their performance and addressing biases. Additionally, the blog provides insights into cutting-edge techniques used in training and refining LLMs, which showcases the ongoing innovation in the field. Other informative blogs from AssemblyAI:

2. [Introduction to Generative AI](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/introduction-generative-ai/)

* [Finetuning LLM](https://lightning.ai/pages/category/tutorial/)

[Sebastian Raschka](https://twitter.com/rasbt) is known for writing some of the best AI-based blogs. He consistently delivers great content through his [blog](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/understanding-large-language-models) and more recently through Lightning AI. He provides highly informative content on topics such as [Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)](https://lightning.ai/pages/community/tutorial/lora-llm/) and [Parameter-Efficient Finetuning](https://lightning.ai/pages/community/tutorial/lora-llm/). The blogs feature pseudocode and visual representations, enhancing the understanding of the concepts.

* [Introduction to Large Language Models](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/539)

This learning guides you through a curated collection of content on Generative AI products and technologies, from the fundamentals of Large Language Models to how to create and deploy generative AI solutions on Google Cloud. It is a growing list.

* [LLM University by Cohere](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/llmu)

The comprehensive NLP curriculum covers the basics to advanced topics in large language models (LLMs). The curriculum is designed for learners from all backgrounds, with hands-on exercises to help you build and deploy your own models. They cover everything from semantic search, generation, classification, embeddings, and more. Their curriculum is one-size-fits-all, so you can pick your own path based on your previous knowledge and goals.

* [Full Stack LLM Bootcamp](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/llm-bootcamp/)

The Full Stack Deep Learning LLM Bootcamp teaches participants how to build and deploy applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). The bootcamp covers a wide range of topics, including prompt engineering, LLMops, and user experience design. It is open to anyone with an interest in LLMs, regardless of their level of experience with machine learning. The [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@The_Full_Stack) are available on YouTube.

* [Product Search with LLM](https://www.databricks.com/blog/enhancing-product-search-large-language-models-llms.html)

Large language models can be used to improve product search by understanding natural language queries and providing more relevant results. This blog post discusses the challenges of traditional search systems and how LLMs can be used to overcome them. It also provides real-world examples of how LLMs are being used to improve product search. [LLM: Application through Production](https://www.edx.org/course/large-language-models-application-through-production) is aimed at developers, data scientists, and engineers looking to build LLM-centric applications with the latest and most popular frameworks.

* [Advances in Foundation Models](https://stanford-cs324.github.io/winter2023/)

This course focuses on the fundamental principles and concepts of distributed systems. It covers topics such as distributed algorithms, consistency and replication, fault tolerance, and distributed storage. It teaches the fundamentals about the modeling, systems and ethical aspects of foundation models. It is a great offering from Stanford.

* [Prompt Engineering Guide by Brex](https://github.com/brexhq/prompt-engineering)

Prompt engineering is the art of writing prompts that get large language models (LLMs) to do what you want them to do. This guide was created by Brex for internal purposes and covers the history of LLMs, as well as strategies, guidelines, and safety recommendations for working with and building programmatic systems on top of LLMs.

* [State of GPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZQun8Y4L2A&ab_channel=MicrosoftDeveloper)

[Andrej Karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy) delivered the "State of GPT" session for the Microsoft Build 2023 event. He explained the GPT assistant training pipeline, which includes pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling, and reinforcement learning. I particularly liked the recommendations at the end of the video. Great [summary thread](https://twitter.com/altryne/status/1661236778458832896)!

* [LLM in Customer Service and Support](https://d1r5llqwmkrl74.cloudfront.net/notebooks/RCG/diy-llm-qa-bot/index.html#diy-llm-qa-bot_1.html)

It shows how we can leverage a large language model in combination with own data to create an interactive application capable of answering questions specific to a particular domain or subject area. The core pattern behind this is the delivery of a question along with a document or document fragment that provides relevant context for answering that question to the model. The model will then respond with an answer that takes into consideration both the question and the context.
