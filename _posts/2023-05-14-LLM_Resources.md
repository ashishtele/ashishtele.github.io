Hi All,

The internet is awash with information about large language models (LLMs). Every day, a plethora of papers are published on LLMs, advancing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks. I personally found it overwhelming to keep up with the research and the rapid pace of development. I am listing a few resources that I found helpful and will keep on adding to this list.

* [The Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)

The blog "The Illustrated Transformer" by [Jay Alammar](https://twitter.com/JayAlammar)  provides a concise and visually appealing explanation of the Transformer model, a basic building block for the current revolution in NLP. It covers the key components and operations of the Transformer, including self-attention and positional encoding, in the best possible way. The blog's illustrations help clarify the model's inner workings, making it accessible and informative for readers interested in understanding the Transformer architecture. If you are a visual learner like me, this should be the starting point for you!

* [Story of Large Language Models](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/the-full-story-of-large-language-models-and-rlhf/)

AssemblyAI's blog, "The Full Story of Large Language Models and RLHF," explores the innovations and advancements in large language models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). The blog delves into the history and development of LLMs, such as GPT-3, and outlines their capabilities and limitations. It highlights the role of RLHF in fine-tuning LLMs and discusses its potential for improving their performance and addressing biases. Additionally, the blog provides insights into cutting-edge techniques used in training and refining LLMs, which showcases the ongoing innovation in the field.

* [Finetuning LLM](https://lightning.ai/pages/category/tutorial/)

[Sebastian Raschka](https://twitter.com/rasbt) is known for writing some of the best AI-based blogs. He consistently delivers great content through his [blog](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/understanding-large-language-models) and more recently through Lightning AI. He provides highly informative content on topics such as [Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)](https://lightning.ai/pages/community/tutorial/lora-llm/) and [Parameter-Efficient Finetuning](https://lightning.ai/pages/community/tutorial/lora-llm/). The blogs feature pseudocode and visual representations, enhancing the understanding of the concepts.
