Hi All,

Design thinking is a problem-solving approach focusing on creating innovative solutions that meet the needs and desires of users. When applied to machine learning problems, it involves identifying the key challenges and opportunities associated with a problem, generating creative ideas for potential solutions, and then prototyping and testing these solutions to refine and improve them.

Design thinking can be applied to problems related to making large language models more accessible to users in large companies. Here are the stages involved in applying design thinking to LLM problem:

**Empathize:** The first stage of design thinking involves understanding the needs and challenges of users who work in large companies and may face barriers in accessing large language models. 
This could include:
1. Employees from different departments or teams with varying levels of access controls
2. Employees with different job roles or responsibilities
3. Employees with different levels of technical expertise 
4. Security and Compliance concers to avoid propritory data leakage to LLM API service providers

Product team may need to conduct user research or engage with stakeholders to understand their respective needs and challenges.

Thank you!!
