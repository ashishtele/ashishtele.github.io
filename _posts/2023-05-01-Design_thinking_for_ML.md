Hi All,

Design thinking is a problem-solving approach focusing on creating innovative solutions that meet the needs and desires of users. When applied to machine learning problems, it involves identifying the key challenges and opportunities associated with a problem, generating creative ideas for potential solutions, and then prototyping and testing these solutions to refine and improve them.

Design thinking can be applied to problems related to making large language models more accessible to stakeholders in large companies. The things look different if we are building solutions for internal stakeholders or designing products for external customers. Here are the stages involved in applying design thinking to LLM problem:

**Empathize:** The first stage of design thinking involves *understanding the needs and challenges of stakeholders* who work in large companies and may face barriers in accessing large language models. 
This could include:
1. Employees from different departments or teams with varying levels of access controls
2. Employees with different job roles or responsibilities
3. Employees with different levels of technical expertise 
4. Security and Compliance concers to avoid propritory data leakage to LLM API service providers

Product team may need to conduct user research or engage with stakeholders to understand their respective needs and challenges.

**Define:** Once the needs and challenges of stakeholders have been identified, the next step is to *define the problem that needs to be solved*. This could involve identifying the key barriers that prevent employees from accessing large language models, such as limited access to technology, lack of training or education, or lack of integration with existing systems or workflows.

**Ideate:** The ideation stage involves *generating creative ideas for potential solutions*. This could include:
1. Leveraging open-source LLM models to experiment
2. Developing new interfaces or integrations that make the language model more accessible to employees
3. Creating new training programs or resources (OCM) that help employees learn how to use the language model
4. Developing new workflows or processes that integrate the language model into existing systems

**Prototype:** Once potential solutions have been identified, the next step is to *create low-fidelity prototypes that can be tested and refined*. This could include:
1. Building MVP/MLP (minimum lovable product) using open-source, commerical usable LLM models
2. Developing a new interface or integration that can be tested with employees
3. Creating a pilot program to test the effectiveness of new training programs or workflows.

**Test:** The final stage of design thinking involves testing the prototypes with users to gather feedback and refine the design. This feedback can then be used to further iterate and improve the solution.

Thank you!!
